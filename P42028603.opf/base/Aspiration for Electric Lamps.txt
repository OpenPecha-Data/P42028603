Aspiration for Electric Lamps
by Gungtang Tenpé Wangchuk

nyidé ö tar sal la münsel shying
Bright like the light of the sun and the moon,
tsikpé dri dang duwé nokpa mé
Dispelling darkness without burning smells or smoke,
tsang shying yi ong lok gi drönmé di
This electric lamp, so clean and charming,
gyalwa sé dangché la güpé bul
I offer with respect to the buddhas and their heirs.

tong sal chöying kha lé jungpa yi
Within the expanse of dharmadhātu, empty and clear,
dang sal ma dré yeshe ö bar wa
The light of wisdom blazes forth, undiluted and pure.
tingdzin trul gyi kukpé lok ö di
May this electric light, conjured by the mystery of samādhi,
marik khorwé tsawa shyom gyur chik
Vanquish all ignorance, the root of cyclic existence.

These words of aspiration for offering electronic lights was composed by the one called Gungtang
Tenpe Wangchuk. Virtue!
